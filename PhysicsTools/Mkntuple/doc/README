I	Setup
---------
	1.	Set up a local release of CMSSW 
	
		scramv1 project CMSSW CMSSW_3_6_1
		cd CMSSW_3_6_1/src
		cmsenv

	2.	Download PhysicsTools/LiteAnalysis and PhysicsTools/Mkntuple:

		cvs co -r v3_6_1 -d PhysicsTools UserCode/SusySapien/PhysicsTools

	3.	Compile and link

		cd PhysicsTools	
		scramv1 b	


II 	Notes
---------

	The Mkntuple system is driven by two important files:

		1.	PhysicsTools/Mkntuple/python/classmap.py

		2.	PhysicsTools/Mkntuple/plugins/classes.txt

The first file is created using

		mkclassmap.py

It constructs a map of DataFormats class names to headers and defines the
universal set of classes from which the subset known to Mkntuple is drawn.

	The 2nd file, classes.txt, lists the classes defined by the RECO and PAT
files supplied to mkclasslist.py, which creates classes.txt:

		mkclasslist.py reco.root pat.root
 
The classes listed classes.txt should be a subset of those listed in 
classmap.py. The script mkplugins.py, which creates 

		3.	PhysicsTools/Mkntuple/plugins/plugins.cc

uses classes.txt to determine the plugins to define and classmap.py to find the
associated header files.


III	Notes
---------

	The script mkdocs.py, which is executed by mkntuplecfi.py the first time it
is run, creates files in the directories

		txt
		html
and		methods

The methods directory contains lists of the methods available to the user.
