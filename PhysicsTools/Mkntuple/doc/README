(A) SETUP

	1.	Set up a local release of CMSSW 
	
		scramv1 project CMSSW CMSSW_3_4_1
		cd CMSSW_3_4_1/src
		cmsenv
		cd PhysicsTools
		source LiteAnalysis/setup(.sh|.csh)

	2.	Download PhysicsTools/LiteAnalysis and PhysicsTools/Mkntuple:

		cvs co -r v3_4_1 -d PhysicsTools UserCode/SusySapien/PhysicsTools

	3.	Compile and link

		scramv1 b	


(B)	EXAMPLE

	1.	Go to your test directory and edit the configuration file
	example.py.

	2.	Replace "pat.root" in "file:pat.root" with the name of your input 
	PAT file and "ntuple.root" with the desired name of your output n-tuple 
	file.

	3.	Run Mkntuple

		cmsRun example.py

	If all goes well, you should find a new n-tuple file in the current
	directory.


(C)	CONFIG FRAGMENT MAKER

	You can get some help in creating a configuration fragment as follows:

	1.	In your test directory execute

		mkntuplecfi.py 

	This program expects to find a directory called "methods" in the
	current working directory. Since that directory does not yet exist, it
	will be created and populated with text files listing all the methods 
	that, in principle, are available to you. Theses files are created from
	the master files in

		$CMSSW_BASE/src/PhysicsTools/LiteAnalysis/dataformats/txt

	You can get an HTML view of these files by pointing your browser to

		$CMSSW_BASE/src/PhysicsTools/LiteAnalysis/dataformats/html/index.html
	
	Once the "methods" directory has been created, a graphical user interface 
	will appear with two tabs, labeled "Methods" and "Selected Methods". Each
	tab, in turn, is divided into three list boxes labeled:

		Classes			Methods			getByLabel
	
	2.	Click on the File/Open menu item (or the File/Open button) and 
	navigate to the location of your input Root file. Select a file and
	return. The file will be scanned, and a list of the most useful classes
	pertaining to it will be displayed in the "Classes" list box.

	3.	Select a class by clicking on the class name. Its methods and the
	available getByLabels will be displayed in the "Methods" and 
	"getByLabel" list boxes, respectively.

	4.	Select one or more methods from the "Methods" list box. Do not
	forget to select at least one "getByLabel". You can display your 
	selection at any time by going to the "Selected Methods" tab. You can
	deselect a method by clicking on the selected method in the "Methods" 
	list box on the Methods tab.

	5.	Click on the File/Save menu item (or the File/Save button) to save
	a file called

		mkntuple_cfi.py

	which you can cut-and-paste into your configuration file, or place it in
	your python directory. If you do the latter, the configuration file
	fragment can be loaded into your configuration file using

		process.load("PhysicsTools.Mkntuple.mkntuple_cfi")

	If you chose to cut-and-paste it directly into your configuration file,
	remember to replace "demo" with "process.demo".
