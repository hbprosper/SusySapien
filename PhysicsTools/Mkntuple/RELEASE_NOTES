v4_1_2:	Feb. 17 2011
--------------------
	1. Merged histogramFile and skimFile into outputFile:

	Call
		outputFile(cmdline.outputfilename)

	to write out histograms only and

		outputFile(cmdline.outputfilename, stream)

	to write out histograms and a tree containing skimmed events.


	2. Added GenEventInfoProductHelper.

	This returns 45 PDF weights per event
		0	central value of PDFs
		1..	shifted values (1 to 44 for GTEQ)

	See genlevel.py in PhysicsTools/Mkntuple/python for example of usage.


	3. Make mkvariables.py work on a larger class of simple ntuples
