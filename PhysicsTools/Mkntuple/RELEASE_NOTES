v4_1_3: Mar. 12 2011
--------------------
	1. Fixed variable naming bug in mkanalyzer.py
	2. rename mkselector.py to mkusermacro.py

	mkusermacro.py creates the template for a user-defined macro that is
	designed to be called by TheNtupleMaker. It is created using an existing
	variables.txt file. The macro can be used to add user-defined variables
	to the ntuple and perform event selection. See the example in the template.

	Example:

		mkusermacro.py mymacro

	creates
		mymacro.cc
		mymacro.h
		mymacro.mk

	which can be compiled and linked using

		make -f mymacro.mk
	
	This creates libmymacro.so. To load this macro into TheNtupleMaker add
	
		macroName = cms.untracked.string("mymacro.cc"),

	to 
		cms.EDAnalyzer("Mkntuple",..
	
	

v4_1_2:	Feb. 17 2011
--------------------
	1. Merged histogramFile and skimFile into outputFile:

	Call
		outputFile(cmdline.outputfilename)

	to write out histograms only and

		outputFile(cmdline.outputfilename, stream)

	to write out histograms and a tree containing skimmed events.


	2. Added GenEventInfoProductHelper.

	This returns 45 PDF weights per event
		0	central value of PDFs
		1..	shifted values (1 to 44 for GTEQ)

	See genlevel.py in PhysicsTools/Mkntuple/python for example of usage.


	3. Make mkvariables.py work on a larger class of simple ntuples
